            Yesterday, I went to the store and got some much needed
            spatulas!(what better way to say I love myself than to buy myself a
            spatula!)

            Cookie cupcakes

            My favorite cartoon character is cookie, and my favorite dessert is
            cupcakes. So Cookie Cupcakes are best of both the worlds. Did you
            know? Cookie character once said, “Sometimes me think what is love,
            and then me think love is what cookie is for. Me give up the last
            cookie for you.” I wonder if the same applies for the cupcakes? (If
            so, I don't think I can ever love ANYONE!)
